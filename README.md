# trojan-asteroid-ephemeris
An intermediate-level project to make animations of the Trojan asteroids (or, any other type of asteroid, really) using astroquery's Horizons module

I made this so I could have extremely customizable animations of the Jupiter Trojans for outreach purposes. Maybe this is something you're interested in doing too? If so, I'd love to see any animations you make with this code.
